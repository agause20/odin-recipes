      <li>russet potatoes</li>
      <li>fresh onions</li>
      <li>eggs</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much
        moisture as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl stir the potatoes, onion, eggs, flour and salt
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil
        until hot. Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil,
        pressing down on them to form 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick patties. Brown on
        one side, turn and brown on the other. Let drain on paper towels. Serve
        hot!
